> To everyone’s surprise, including myself 😅 — I decided to serve in the army for a year. I can’t say for sure what led me to this decision, but it was a mix of wanting to test my limits and being influenced by some family members 👨‍👩‍👦.

>2017 was a wild and incredibly productive year for me. I learned a lot, and in many ways, I gained control over my mind, desires, and emotions 🧠. And of course, I learned how to survive in the jungle 🌴 and paint curbs 🪣🎨.

# 💼 Roles I Performed:

- ### 🧑🏻‍🎓 Student
#### February 2017 - December 2017 (11 months)
A year of training to become a reserve officer at CPOR/R. I've got 1st place in the Cavalry Course 🥇 and won the Correia Lima Medal Award.

- ### 🪖 Platoon Leader
#### March 2018 – March 2019 (1 year, 1 month)
My first role was an operational one where I led a group of soldiers in every aspect — guiding, supporting, and training them. Most of our time was dedicated to learning, teaching, practicing, and applying military tactics and combat strategies ⚔️🧭.

- ### 📦 Logistics Manager
#### March 2019 – December 2023 (4 years, 10 months)
This was an administrative role. I managed a large warehouse that stored almost every type of material you can imagine. Among many responsibilities, I had to control, maintain, preserve, ration, distribute, and restock all supplies — which sometimes totaled up more than 4 million reais 💰📦.

---

- ### 📊 Fiscal Director
#### December 2023 – June 2024 (7 months)
In this role, I was one of the responsible team for the financial and administrative management of the military organization I was serving. I had a comprehensive view of all economic operations, overseeing planning, budgeting, asset control, and property management 💼🏛️.
